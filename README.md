# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?:
-The project was designed for DriverPass who wanted a user-focused system that addressed several functional and security requirements with the goal to improve driving test/pass rates. The system included features like lesson scheduling, DMV integration, progress tracking.

What did you do particularly well?:
-I was able to illustrate the functional, technical, and security requirements clearly. I was able to explain thoroughly the business requirements document the purpose, objective, and goals of each of the requirements listed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?:
-I would redo some of my UML diagrams that I created. Some of them were inconsistent and lacked clarity or depth into the business logic that needed to be explained. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?:
-I addressed the users needs by designing features like easy lesson scheduling, supporting secure logins and data transfer, and creating a visualized workflow that tracks their progress. This was important to focus on because by considering the needs of the user, it will ensure a system that the user sees value in and trusts. Which will support future retention of user activity. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?:
-First I analyze the client requirements, and break them down into functional and nonfunctional components. I then create diagrams that help visualize the worldflow. In particular building the project with a modular design structure would allow for strong scalability. This would allow for testing to take place earlier in the project's development life cycle.
